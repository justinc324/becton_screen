We met on Friday, September 6th to complete our mapping assignment.
Itai wrote the initial processing code and varsha had the idea to make each of the squares correspond to letters of the alphbet.In the beginning we found a way to isolate the big screen but the smaller squares in the hallway were still confusing. Justin and Itai began working on a program to move around a square to isolate where the individual square was. We could move the square using arrow keys and scale the small colored square using different letter keys. After our first day of work we were able to get a rough idea of how the becton screens correspond to the screen on the computer. We determined that each of the big section is roughly a third of the computer screen. To prevent ourselves from shouting at eachother all over the becton center, we decided to communicate as a team through cellphone.
