We met on Friday, September 6th to complete our mapping assignment.
Itai wrote the initial processing code and varsha had the idea to make each of the squares correspond to letters of the alphbet.In the beginning we found a way to isolate the big screen but the smaller squares in the hallway were still confusing. Justin and Itai began working on a program to move around a square to isolate where the individual square was. We could move the square a specific amount of pixels in any direction using different keystrokes, and scale the small colored square using different letter keys. After having found where the colored square covers the squares we would print the coordinates of the top left corner and the side lengths to the console.  We determined that each of the 3 big sections are roughly a third of the computer screen respectively. We scaled our little square to be much larger in order to determine the size of the main cafe screen and used the same coordinate printing method in the cafe. 


After our first day of work we were able to get a highly accurate sense of how the becton screens correspond to the screen on the computer.
